Creating a website for selling online snacks like Samosa and Vadapav, with a focus on Mumbai street food, is a great project idea. Here's a basic outline of what you'll need:

1. **Homepage:**
   - Introduction to your website and its purpose.
   - High-quality images of Mumbai street food.
   - A call to action (CTA) for visitors to explore your menu or place an order.

2. **Menu Page:**
   - List of snacks available with descriptions and prices.
   - Images of each snack.
   - An option to select the quantity and add items to the cart.

3. **Cart Page:**
   - A summary of items in the cart.
   - The ability to update the quantity or remove items.
   - A total cost calculation.
   - A "Checkout" button to proceed to the order.

4. **Checkout Page:**
   - A form for customers to enter their delivery information.
   - Payment options (if you want to handle payments on the website).
   - Confirmation of the order.

5. **Contact Page:**
   - Contact information, including an email address, phone number, and physical address (if applicable).
   - A contact form for inquiries.

6. **About Page:**
   - Information about your business, its history, and your passion for Mumbai street food.

Now, the harder parts:

1. **Online Ordering System:** Implementing a secure and functional shopping cart system can be challenging, especially if you plan to handle payments online. You might want to consider using e-commerce platforms like WooCommerce for WordPress or Shopify if you're not experienced with web development.

2. **Payment Processing:** Setting up payment processing can be complex. You'll need to integrate a payment gateway like PayPal, Stripe, or others.

3. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that your website is responsive, meaning it looks and functions well on various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

4. **User Authentication (Optional):** If you want to allow customers to create accounts and save their delivery information for future orders, you'll need user authentication and database functionality.

5. **SEO and Marketing:** Promoting your website and making it discoverable on search engines (SEO) is crucial for attracting customers. You may want to learn about SEO and online marketing techniques.

Remember that creating a fully functional e-commerce website can be a complex and time-consuming project, especially if you're new to web development. If you encounter difficulties, don't hesitate to seek help from web development tutorials, forums, or consider hiring a professional developer. Good luck with your project!
